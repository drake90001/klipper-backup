#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines

#   Most moves will accelerate to a cruising speed, travel at that

#   travel a short distance could nominally accelerate and then
#   immediately decelerate. This option reduces the top speed of these
#   moves to ensure there is always a minimum distance traveled at a
#   cruising speed. That is, it enforces a minimum distance traveled
#   at cruising speed relative to the total distance traveled. It is
#   intended to reduce the top speed of short zigzag moves (and thus
#   reduce printer vibration from these moves). For example, a
#   minimum_cruise_ratio of 0.5 would ensure that a standalone 1.5mm
#   move would have a minimum cruising distance of 0.75mm. Specify a
#   ratio of 0.0 to disable this feature (there would be no minimum
#   cruising distance enforced between acceleration and deceleration).

horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#mesh_radius:
#   Defines the radius of the mesh to probe for round beds. Note that
#   the radius is relative to the coordinate specified by the
#   mesh_origin option. This parameter must be provided for round beds
#   and omitted for rectangular beds.
#mesh_origin:
#   Defines the center X, Y coordinate of the mesh for round beds. This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. It may be useful
#   to adjust the mesh_origin in an effort to maximize the size of the
#   mesh radius. Default is 0, 0. This parameter must be omitted for
#   rectangular beds.
mesh_min: 5, 15
#   Defines the minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
mesh_max: 185, 235
#   Defines the maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
probe_count: 3,3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values X, Y defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
fade_start: 1
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
fade_end: 0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
fade_target: .01
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
mesh_pps: 3, 3
#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .1
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
zero_reference_position: 162.5,117.5
#   An optional X,Y coordinate that specifies the location on the bed
#   where Z = 0.  When this option is specified the mesh will be offset
#   so that zero Z adjustment occurs at this location.  The default is
#   no zero reference.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.
adaptive_margin: 25
#   An optional margin (in mm) to be added around the bed area used by
#   the defined print objects when generating an adaptive mesh.
#scan_overshoot:
#  The maximum amount of travel (in mm) available outside of the mesh.
#  For rectangular beds this applies to travel on the X axis, and for round beds
#  it applies to the entire radius.  The tool must be able to travel the amount
#  specified outside of the mesh.  This value is used to optimize the travel
#  path when performing a "rapid scan".  The minimum value that may be specified
#  is 1.  The default is no overshoot.

[fan_generic auxiliary_fan]
pin: PD12
#   Output pin controlling the fan. This parameter must be provided.
max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully
#   enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the
#   pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This setting may
#   be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to
#   the fan. If this value is less than 1.0 then fan speed requests
#   will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if
#   max_power is .9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested then the fan
#   power will be set to 72%). The default is 1.0.
shutdown_speed: 0.0
#   The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if
#   the micro-controller software enters an error state. The default
#   is 0.
cycle_time: 0.0025
#   The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the
#   fan. It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when
#   using software based PWM. The default is 0.010 seconds.
hardware_pwm: True
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. Most fans
#   do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to
#   enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at
#   very high speeds. When using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is
#   constrained by the implementation and may be significantly
#   different than the requested cycle_time. The default is False.
kick_start_time: 0.200
#   Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first
#   enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan
#   spinning). The default is 0.100 seconds.
off_below: 0.15
#   The minimum input speed which will power the fan (expressed as a
#   value from 0.0 to 1.0). When a speed lower than off_below is
#   requested the fan will instead be turned off. This setting may be
#   used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure kick starts are
#   effective. The default is 0.0.
#   This setting should be recalibrated whenever max_power is adjusted.
#   To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the
#   fan spinning. Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest
#   input speed which reliably drives the fan without stalls. Set
#   off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for
#   example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher.
#tachometer_pin:
#   Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed. A pullup is generally
#   required. This parameter is optional.
#tachometer_ppr: 2
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per
#   revolution of the tachometer signal. For a BLDC fan this is
#   normally half the number of poles. The default is 2.
#tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0015
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the
#   tachometer pin, in seconds. The default is 0.0015, which is fast
#   enough for fans below 10000 RPM at 2 PPR. This must be smaller than
#   30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the
#   maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.
#enable_pin:
#   Optional pin to enable power to the fan. This can be useful for fans
#   with dedicated PWM inputs. Some of these fans stay on even at 0% PWM
#   input. In such a case, the PWM pin can be used normally, and e.g. a
#   ground-switched FET(standard fan pin) can be used to control power to
#   the fan.
